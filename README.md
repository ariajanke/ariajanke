# Development Ideas

## untitled-runner-game
- add events (death and level completion)
## blockgames
- controller config graphics (simplify)
- score board for the Quadnomials derivative
## ...and beyond
- need new web project ideas (an online recipe thing?)
- How can I tie this to some semblence of vocational goals?
