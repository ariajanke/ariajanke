# About Me
I have a picrew avatar *AND* a computer science degree! Which is from the school of the LS&A at the University of Michigan. I am presently a very happy new hire in an apprenticeship with the Pesto Group. I've been busy learning new tools/frameworks/languages with the wonderful people at this company.

# Past Projects

### RESTful Recipes API
This is a part of the "ofdb-sample" project. This API computes the nutrition facts of recipes based on their respective ingredients. It even has features to process nested ingredients. You can read a transcript of a demo of this API in the "subproject's" [README](https://github.com/ariajanke/ofdb-sample/blob/main/recipe-api/README.md#user-content-demo).

### AABB Physics Library
Axis Aligned Bounding Box physics library. Physics can be very tricky to implement (especially from "scratch"). Here I manage to get by using knowledge with floating points, and learn a bit about WASM along the way.

### PSOBB Mag Feeder
This JavaScript SPA I wrote is for an old MMORPG from the early 2000s. It was also an exercise in CSS. I'm no page designer, but I strive something a bit more useable than plain HTML.
