# My Projects

### PSOBB Mag Feeder
This JavaScript SPA I wrote is for an old MMORPG from the early 2000s. It was also an exercise in CSS. I'm no page designer, but I strive something a bit more useable than plain HTML.

### AABB Physics Library
Axis Aligned Bounding Box physics library. Physics can be very tricky to implement (especially from "scratch"). Here I manage to get by using knowledge with floating points, and learn a bit about WASM along the way.
